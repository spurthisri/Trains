TRAINS SOLUTION:

1) Created Edge and Vertex classes to represent edges and vertices respectively.
2) Vertex properties - name and visited
3) Edge properties - origin, destination, weight and next edge.
4) Created Graph class where all the required operations are defined.
5) Created GraphMain class where main method is defined.
	- Try running this class with all the inputs and check if the correct results are shown.
